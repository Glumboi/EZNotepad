# EZNotepad
This app is pretty much done only things i will maybe add in the future are:  -A bit better and good looking UI -More functions for the text field such as drag and drop which is already included ut doesnt work for some reason -Also i am planning in adding a cpu and ram usage indicator but that will ome later or even  not maybe im still thinking about it  Feel free to edit the app and re release it but i would like to get credits :)  Also if anyone wonders i used material skin for the GUI
